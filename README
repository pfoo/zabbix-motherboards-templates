Supermicro A1SAM-2750F (IPMI): 
* Need to turn on zabbix server ipmi polling in zabbix configuration file (StartIPMIPollers=1)
* Need zabbix host to be configured with IPMI information, with at least user privilege level; Authentication algorithm default
* Under Debian / Ubuntu, OpenIPMI is currently compiled with ssl turned off (https://support.zabbix.com/browse/ZBX-6139). You will need to rebuild openipmi package in order to have ipmi working with zabbix. See https://support.zabbix.com/browse/ZBX-6139?focusedCommentId=149255&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-149255 for build instruction.
* Template interval is set to 300s, but you might need to set a least 1 item to a 60s update interval or you might see the "Network error while retrieving IPMI data" bug (see https://support.zabbix.com/browse/ZBX-3243)
